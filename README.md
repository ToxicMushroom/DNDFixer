# DNDFixer
## Do not disturb always reenable service

Reason for creations -> my oneplus 5t has a notification policy slider: ringing, silent, vibrate. Sadly when moving this slider the DND state is reset to off.

Steps to use:
1. Install app using android studio or smth
2. Open app
3. Click `SETTINGS` button and enable the switch
4. Click `OPEN SETTINGS` button to allow DND modify permissions for DNDFixer app
5. Click Schedule to start the service, service will keep scheduling itself so once is fine, service will also start automatically after reboot and cold-boot.

Note: you might want to turn off battery optimisations for this app.

Contributions for improvements and/or fixes are welcome.
If you want to add a feature please make an issue first.
